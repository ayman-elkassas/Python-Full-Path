## 1- Python Full Path ![Python Full Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python%20Full%20Path-orange.svg)

>Python is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. It is open source, so the interpreter and source are freely available and distributable in binary form. Python has many built-in high-level data structures and utilizes dynamic typing and binding, making it an excellent choice for both scripting and application development. Programming in Python can be extremely quick and productive owing to the lack of a compilation step as well as the built-in debugger (also written in Python). This fast edit-test-debug cycle is one of the main draws for programmers who wish to develop in Python, while others are drawn to the active and passionate Python community. This path will take you from the basics of the Python language all the way up to working with web frameworks and programming a Raspberry Pi.

## 2- Building Machine Learning ![Building Machine Learning Models in Python with scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Building%20Machine%20Learning%20Models%20in%20Python%20with%20scikit%20learn-orange.svg)

>This course course will help engineers and data scientists learn how to build machine learning models using scikit-learn, one of the most popular ML libraries in Python. No prior experience with ML needed, only basic Python programming knowledge.

### Description
> The Python scikit-learn library is extremely popular for building traditional ML models i.e. those models that do not rely on neural networks. In this course, Building Machine Learning Models in Python with scikit-learn, you will see how to work with scikit-learn, and how it can be used to build a variety of machine learning models. First, you will learn how to use libraries for working with continuous, categorical, text as well as image data. Next, you will get to go beyond ordinary regression models, seeing how to implement specialized regression models such as Lasso and Ridge regression using the scikit-learn libraries. Finally, in addition to supervised learning techniques, you will also understand and implement unsupervised models such as clustering using the mean-shift algorithm and dimensionality reduction using principal components analysis. At the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of the pros and cons of the various regression, classification, and unsupervised learning models covered and you will be extremely comfortable using the Python scikit-learn library to build and train your models. Software required: scikit-learn, Python 3.x.
